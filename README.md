	 Discord Activity Bot , The Voice Channel Activity Bot.

  <br>
</h1>


hey! i'm sweqtyy. this bot right here is an discord activity bot, that will get frequently updated. It contains every current Discord Voice Activity Game. It's a public bot for any server, but I don't mind if you use my code for your own use or if you wanna revamp the code. this bot wasn't made ALL by me, but i helped out in most of it and fixed and squashed any bugs that caused the bot to go down, or not work. This bot will also have some misc commands just for fun. None of these commands should be able to be abused, just for fun commands.

## How Do I Utilize This Code For Personal Use?
It's easy! You can clone my repo, or download it like from the picture below. Replace `process.env.TOKEN` with your Discord Bot Token from [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications). There are many other ways to download and do all this, but I'm simply giving you a easy path to follow. This code doesn't utilze a discordjs folder with all the dependencies and fancy stuff, so that's why that isn't here.

note, this isn't a full tutorial on how to make a bot or use this type of code, i don't really reccomend it, i just used it because it was a quick way to make this bot since it doesn't have much utilization purposes. to make a bot, watch youtube videos or go to the discordjs website, they have everything there too.

## I want do add this to my discord server, but how?

Don't want to go through the coding hassle? add the bot quickly with this hyperlink here:

[Invite the Bot](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=751195834468532296&permissions=240519605457&scope=bot) 

NOTE: the perms there are somewhat needed, just to make sure that the bot works properly and doesnt break on ya'll. 

## Important Info to Know

Discord Bot Activities is in BETA, meaning there is bugs, and much more stuff you will encounter. I can't fix any of this, nor can you. Any bugs can be reported to the [Discord Game Lab](https://discord.com/invite/discordgameslab) discord server. this guild is made by discord themself, and allows you to play games and test them early. Any time I get a chance or a new game comes out, I will work on bringing it to this bot ASAP. It takes time though.


I do not mind if you remove my credits from the code, but please don't run around saying this code is yours. it's not, and it's barely mine. I just rewrote some stuff and messed around and put it into heroku.

any bugs with the bot itself, should be reported to me, either the [issues](https://github.com/sweqtyy/BSIBOT/issues) tab or my discord, which is sweqtyy#0001.
